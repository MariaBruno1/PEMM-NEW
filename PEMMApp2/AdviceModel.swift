        Advice(name: "The puppy lying down", description: "To move from the previous exercise to this exercise you can perform a fluid movement. This asana lengthens the spine and relaxes the shoulders. Starting from the previous yoga position, bring your hands forward until your forearms are resting on the ground and your buttocks are facing upwards. The elbows are now where the hands previously rested. The knees form a right angle and are hip-width apart. During this yoga exercise, your forehead almost touches the mat.", imageName: "The puppy lying down image"),
        Advice(name: "Downward facing dog", description: "This yoga position is one of the best known asanas. Stretches your entire body and strengthens your back and shoulders. If performed regularly, this exercise can relieve headaches and neck pain. Starting from a quadruped position, place your toes on the ground, inhale deeply and as you exhale push your hips up. Your body now forms an inverted V. Arms and legs are well stretched and the back is relaxed. You can maintain this position or walk a little on the spot, so as to loosen the ligaments and tendons.", imageName: "Downward facing dog"),
        Advice(name: "Forward bends", description: "The next yoga pose strengthens your mind, improves your flexibility, increases blood flow to the brain, and stretches your ligaments. Thanks to the pressure exerted by your feet on the floor, this exercise engages you both physically and mentally. Starting in downward-facing dog position, bring your feet forward toward the center of the mat. Lean forward and touch your toes or hug your lower legs. The legs should not be straight but slightly bent in a relaxed manner. But make sure you keep your back straight. Then relax your shoulders and arms in a controlled manner. If your neck starts to pull, move your head slightly to the right and left. Hold this yoga position for 5 deep breaths.", imageName: "Forward bends"),
        Advice(name: "The mountain", description: "Now return to an upright position slowly, vertebra by vertebra, from bottom to top. Then perform two or three shoulder circles until you reach mountain position. Place your feet together or open them hip-width apart, push your pelvis forward and avoid arching your back. Keep your arms relaxed at your sides, with your palms facing your legs. Inhale and exhale deeply. When you're ready, spread your fingers and extend your arms upwards. Press your feet firmly into the ground, push your chest out, and stretch your entire body to your fingertips. Look at your hands and inhale and exhale deeply 3 times. As you exhale, slowly lower your arms and join your hands behind your back. Then raise your hands behind your back and push your chest out.", imageName: "The mountain image")
